                <h2>Rise in A&E visits for hiccups and earaches add to strain on NHS</h2>
                <p>
                    The NHS in England is facing mounting pressure amid a surge in patients attending 
                    A&E departments with minor ailments, health bosses have said.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Emergency departments, which are designed for serious injuries and life-threatening
                    emergencies only, are seeing an increase in people attending with sore throats, 
                    insomnia, coughs and earache.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Data analysed by the Press Association news agency also shows more people going to 
                    A&E with complaints such as hiccups, nasal congestion, backache and nausea.

                <h2>Third space station leak in a year prompts doubts about Russia s programme</h2>
                <p>
                    The Russian segment of the International Space Station (ISS) has sprung its third 
                    coolant leak in under a year, raising new questions about the reliability of the 
                    country s space programme even as officials said crew members were not in danger.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Flakes of frozen coolant spraying into space were seen in an official live feed of
                    the orbital lab provided by Nasa on Monday, and confirmed in radio chatter between
                    US mission control and astronauts.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “The Nauka module of the Russian segment of the ISS has suffered a coolant leak 
                    from the external (backup) radiator circuit, which was delivered to the station 
                    in 2012,” Russian space agency Roscosmos said on Telegram, adding temperatures 
                    remained normal in the affected unit.

                <h2>Parties, jetskis, second homes: how tourism threatens one of the world s only bioluminescent bays</h2>
                <p>
                    Every year, tourists from across the globe flock to the south-west corner of 
                    Puerto Rico to witness a phenomenon found in only a few select locations worldwide.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Here in the idyllic coastal region of La Parguera in Lajas, the main attraction is 
                    a bay by the same name: filled with microscopic plankton that can glow in the dark, 
                    the bay turns into a sparkly blue lagoon after sundown. This is one of the only 
                    bioluminescent bays in the world; nighttime visitors rush to see it up close, 
                    pushing off into the shimmering waters in kayaks.

                <h2>Jude Bellingham’s artistry can take Gareth Southgate’s sad song and make it better</h2>
                <p>
                    First you need the vision. “Around the pitch I want to be an artist,” Jude Bellingham 
                    says, which is the sort of quote that makes you double-take, because what footballer 
                    even talks about making art these days? Well Geoff, at the end of the day it’s all about
                    engaging in a search for deeper meaning, washing away from the soul the dust of everyday 
                    life, creating a new kind of sense where none previously existed. Fortunately, on this 
                    occasion, the big man’s got his head on it.                
                </p>
                <p>
                    And perhaps the most thrilling thing about watching Bellingham at the moment is not the 
                    goals (11 in all competitions) or the assists (four) or the celebrations (broad, open-armed, 
                    inviting us to embrace him), but that little gap between the moment of creation and the moment 
                    of realisation. When he’s trapped by the touchline and plotting his escape route. Or the shuffle 
                    that shifts the ball out of his feet and opens up whole new dimensions of possibility. You don’t 
                    know how this ends, because nor does he.
                </p>
